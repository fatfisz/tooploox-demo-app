# tooploox-demo-app

A demo app for Tooploox. Nothing less, nothing more.

## Getting started

As a prerequisite, [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) are required.
Once you have that, run this command in the project root directory:

```sh
yarn
```

Once that is done, start the app with this command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

After the server has started, you can go to http://localhost:3000 to use the app.

## Commands

- `dev`: starts the development version of the Next.js app
- `validate`: runs the linter, the type checker, and the tests
- `lint`: lints the code
- `lint:fix`: lints the code and fixes what can be automatically fixed
- `types`: runs the TypeScript checks
- `test`: runs the tests
- `build` and `start`: builds and starts the production version of the Next.js app, respectively
